**You've made a web service or sombody has given you a WSDL. So what are the input and output?**   Check the WSDL? No, that's not readable. Instead you can use **wsdl2html** to **generate a readable HTML page from WSDL url**

See?  You will love it!

**Sometimes as a developer you haven't got the WSDL ready**. Instead you've just finished the jax-ws stubs:

But you still want a HTML spec right away. In this case you can still use **wsdl2html** to **generate a readable HTML page from jax-ws stubs**
